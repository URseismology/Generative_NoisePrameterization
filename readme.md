Abstract
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The receiver function (RF) technique is a way to study the structure of the Earthâ€™s crust and upper mantle by using data from teleseismic earthquakes. When seis- mic signals are recorded they are always convolved with inter crustal reverbera- tions and noise. These makes the singal anaysis harder and in order to analyze Seismologist needs to deconvolve those noises to generate accurate receiver func- tions which can then be used to analyse velocity structure beneath the receiver. Though a variety of deconvolution techniques have been developed, they are all adversely affected by background and signal-generated noise. In order to take into account the unknown noise characteristics Seismologist has previously used Bayesian inference in which both the noise magnitude and noise spectral charac- ter are parameters in calculating the receiver functions. In this project I propose to build a generative deep learning diffusion model which can better estimate the noise information and thus in turn can imporve a more accurate receiver function realization.
